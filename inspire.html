<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>My hero is the best impressionist ever. And also, he can run a three hour marathon. He also said that in Hollywood, the kindest people are the most talented.</p>
<p>Over the last 100 years no one exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called on people to be accountable for the racial prejudices they carried. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.</p>

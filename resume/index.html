      <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          I base my job search on three criteria. Comprehension of job requirements, ability to perform the requirements, 
          and providing a service which benefits all parties.
           Currently being in school to further my education in finance, and having recently graduated with 
          an accounting degree, I am prepared to embark on more professional pursuits.
           It is important to me to find an income within the field I am currently involved in, accounting and finance. But of course, adaptability is 
           something I put a lot of effort into, so I would consider virtually anything.

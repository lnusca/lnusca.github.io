        To illustrate the standard of excellence I would like to bring to the orginization I would like to 
        reference a person I admire that references a person he admires. My role model Charlie Day 
        chose to summarize his work experience and skill into one image at an interview, the picture of a victorious Bruce Jenner.
        And this is the kind of second degree energy I would like to bring to the organization.

      <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          I base my job search on three criteria. Comprehension of job requirements, ability to perform the requirements, 
          and providing a service which benefits all parties.
           Currently being in school to further my education in finance, and having recently graduated with 
          an accounting degree, I am prepared to embark on more professional pursuits.
           It is important to me to find an income within the field I am currently involved in, accounting and finance. But of course, adaptability is 
           something I put a lot of effort into, so I would consider virtually anything.

      <h2>Other Experience</h2>
        <p id="last">
          In addition to the work listed above I have gained valuable experience in other paying and non paying roles.
           For instance, I have <strong>farmed</strong> christmas trees, <strong>assisted</strong> in biology research, <strong>built</strong> houses, 
           <strong>designed</strong> athletic games, 
           <strong>created</strong> useful artwork, <strong>repurposed </strong> household goods, <strong>tailored</strong> stylish suits, 
           <strong>raised</strong> chickens, <strong>grown</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong> compost, 
           <strong>rehabilitated</strong> animals, <strong>provided</strong> resources to the needy, and many more pursuits that have taken high degrees of commitment. 
           I also have an affinity for record keeping which is why I earned a degree in accounting but it also is a testimony 
           to my strong attention to detail in endeavors of complexity.

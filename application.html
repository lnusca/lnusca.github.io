      <h2>How to play the game called love?</h2>
      <p>This game can be interacted with in different ways. The story mode gets you aquanted with a highschool girl named
        Grace and you sort of play her inner conciouse. Of course her journey to love is laid by many difficult choices and you are there
        to give her advice. Its a game that can go in many different ways. If you hate boys, then you might lead Grace to do 
        the same. But if you believe in true love on a particular day, then Grace will be glad to explore that with you!

        Another aspect of the game is the infinitly intriguing name tester. Here you can compare two names and see 
        how compatible the super high tech love tester says they are!

                A bright yellow tinkle among its foilage, the Western Tanager is 
                often confused with the Goldfinch until the viewer realizes its much more 
                striking sporting a near neon wardrobe. Mostly staying in the high country, the 
                Tanager has occasionally been seen in urban vallies. You will
                always remember when and where you see your first Western Tanager.

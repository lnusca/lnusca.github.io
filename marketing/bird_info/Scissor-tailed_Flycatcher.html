        <p>
            Does alot on the wing and figures to eat on it as well as small buzzing treats are just as good plucked right 
            out of thin air. Sporting a pair of long dramatic tails as if a noble man in the victorian age, the Flycatcher 
            can sing with the best of them, being able to mimick sounds of bolder more aggressive birds like Jays and Peckers.

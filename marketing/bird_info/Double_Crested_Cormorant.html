            <h1>Double-crested Cormorant</h1>
            <p>
                At first, you think you see the most confident goose ever. Nope, thats the Cormorant with open arms
                 spending time in the 
                same waters as the goose, at the same time of year, and often, on the same migration 
                routes. And the wings sprawled pose it likes to do is for drying feathers under 
                the wings. Other water birds don't have to do this because their feathers are waterproof. 
                Evolution works in different ways to achieve the same thing. For instince to stay dry, 
                it makes waterproof feathers and other times it figures it could just have the bird 
                feel like it needs to sun-bath after swimming for an hour. It probably only took a couple bad 
                rashes for the Cormorant to realize it could simply air dry. Problem solved; it gets fish wether evolutions granted it or not.

                To birders, the Cormorant is slightly 
                more exiting to see than a canadian goose, but somehow keeps your attention far longer. And its worth it 
                because for not being too vocal, the Cormorant is antzy enough to eventually animate itself in interesting ways.

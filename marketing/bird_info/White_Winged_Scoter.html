            You'll see these bird battalians making blue lines across bays and big bodies of water just five feet off the surface. 
            Big waves and powerful oceans don't intimidate them at all as they plow against the energy of the elements. 
            Always wearing a confident glair on thier face much like seasoned sailers without one wince of the waters capabilities, the Scoter 
            is ready for anything.

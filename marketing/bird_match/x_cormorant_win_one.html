            This is a match one would see in a taboo bazzar who pairs their nightly line up with odd 
            circus-like oppenents, it hard to imagine 
            these two players are both from the same organism class, Aves. One looks like a serpentine 
            dinosaur, 
            and the other, a christmas tree ornament with a lightbulb inside. The Tanager possibly has the most
            vivid color of any living thing. Even in full rocky mountain daylight, a glimmer will sparkle 
            from a tree as if a shiney mirror is perched, instead you will be delighted 
            to find a fluttering, busy lifeform.

            The less likely to win a beutey contest, the Cormorant, on the other, hand has been known 
            to repulse its spectaters at first glance. It has a macaub history for this reason, being 
            persecuted for its goulish impression and kulled almost to 
            extinction in the first part of the last century. From this generational adversity, the Cormorant 
            has barreled onto prominance again. Because of this journey, the underdog take the cake, the Cormorant.

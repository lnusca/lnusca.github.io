          A night hunter relies on silent flight, and Night Herons are no exception. Living a batman-like lifestyle, the Night Heronâ€™s broad wings flap silently as they navigate a Gotham wetland. Unlike the almost constantly airborne Throated Swift, Night Herons perch motionless for hours as they wait for unsuspecting fish and amphibians.
          Throated Swifts fly in the sunlight and spend the entire day gliding in flight. They even mate in the air, free falling in ecstasy. If the Night Heron is Batman, the Throated Swift is a sky reaper semi-god harvesting air with its scythe shaped wings. 
          Even though the Night Heron can teach the Throated Swift a couple things about flying at night, the throated swift wins because it conquers gravity all day long.

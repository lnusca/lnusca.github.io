          These two competitors are stars of adaptation, one for the desert land, one for freezing waters. Coming from two extremes in the avian world, this battle will be decided by 
          impressiveness. Running 20 miles an hour to grab a deadly rattlesnake by the neck before fatally bludgeoning it over the head, carries more danger and showmanship than any WWE 
          or Houdini act. But as impressive as this is, the iconic greater roadrunner is an antisocial creature who has only mastered the terrestrial sphere.

          The white winged scoter in contrast has mastered both the atmospheric and aquatic worlds. It not only flys great distances in the air from coastal waters to inland great lakes and wetlands, 
          but also swims and dives like the water is just more air to move in. Seeing a flock of great winged scooters playing in the salty swirling blustering winds above the ocean is breathtaking, but when they dive 60 feet into freezing water for food, staying underwater for impossibly long times, that wins all the impressive points in this battle!

            The Cormorant has worked hard to survive and adapt—a living dinosaur among us that, despite all odds, still endures. 
            Life hasn’t handed it anything on a silver platter. It lacks even the luxury of waterproof feathers, forced instead to 
            perch with wings outstretched like a dark crucifix, drying itself after every hard-earned dive for fish.
            Meanwhile, the Throated Swift glides effortlessly through the skies—not because it labored for that grace, but because 
            it was gifted by the gods with a body designed for airborne delight. It lives in a different realm, untouched by struggle, drifting like a feathered wisp across the heavens.
            To humans, the Swift may seem like a fairy and the Cormorant like a demon, but the Cormorant has earned its place as the champion in this battle.

            Both of these birds work very well with others. Chickadees almost act as a hive
            single mind. If one hears a seed fall then they must all check and see! It is the reason 
            of thier ubiquitousness. Chances are that the random birds you may happen to glance at around
            a tree or a bush and not think about it, are Chickadees. The original small bird fixture.
            But if the Chickadees are a good team then the White Winged Scoter is a well oiled squad of 
            flying formations. It might not be as much for survivability as the Chickadee but they do 
            make for an amazing spectical when they tear through the air five feet above choppy seas. The theme to 
            Top Gun plays in your head.<br><br>
            For that reason, the Scoter Wins!

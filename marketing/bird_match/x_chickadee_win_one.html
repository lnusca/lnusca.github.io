            Depending how you feel about talking, we must recognize the 
            social benefits of it for creatures, including us humans. And including the better talker
            the Chickadee. As the writers of Readers Digest glamorizes many things with its word smithing,
            none better than saying "bulletins are continually disseminated throughout the company" when refering to 
            their networking skills.

            The Flycatcher is more of a one animal show. But a show absolutly. Somersaulting through the air 
            to impress only one other, hopefully its mate. Knowing he is beutiful with nine inch tassel like tail feathers
            that accent the grace of his flight, he lives a simple life in the bosom of Texas warmth all year. Specialized 
            so well to catch bugs on the wing, he figures he doesn't need anything else, and thats just fine. A home-body is 
            nothing to be embarrased about, especially when defending it sternly, but here the win goes to the well traveled 
            chatter bug, the Chickadee.
